<h1>Its Me:</h1>

Hello World!, My Name Is Kunal. I am 12 Passout student but i have interest in knowlageble things like this one.
I am creating this for making simple http server for beginers like with 0.1% knowlage any one can use this server.
This is WLAN http server desiagn.

You can run it in simple localhost server or you can simple run on wifi. When a persion is connected to same wifi as you are 
he will can see your content.


<h1>About installation and setup:</h1>
<table>

<tr>
<th>Copy link</th>
<th>git clone https://github.com/kedar1830/Simple-Server.git
</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>Change directory</th>
<th>cd Simple-Server</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>Execute permission</th>
<th>chmod +x Server-Installation.sh</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>Run the script</th>
<th>./Server-Installation.sh</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>Well done if you did all things then run last command</th>
<th>./start</th>
</tr>

</table>

<h1>Little bit changes you can do:</h1>

Now all done if you wana run server then just go to Simple-Server directory and give it command ./start

<h3>For Termux users:</h3> 

If your using Termux then i recommand you have to install termux-api, it will help you for opening url by using Termux directly.

After installing termux-api,  goto simple server directory use following command:

nano start

paste following command before ->

node server.js 

<mark>termux-open-url http://0.0.0.0:3000/</mark>

now its done and run ./start for testing its working or not.

<h3>This is for all users:</h3>

you can change its ports and ip by your self if you wana!
